# MT-LIFT
*MT-LIFT* is an large-scale and unbiased dataset collected from two months of coupon marketing scenarios for food delivery in the Meituan App, [Meituan (美团)]([https://www.kuaishou.com/cn](https://www.meituan.com/)).  To eliminate the impact of confounding factors on uplift modeling, we collect it from randomized controlled trials, where treatments were randomly assigned to ensure consistent potential distribution between the treatment and control groups. **It is the first unbiased industrial dataset featuring multiple treatments and comprehensive chain label (click and conversion) information!**
